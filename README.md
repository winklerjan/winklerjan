### welcome to my profile ðŸ‘¾

âœ¨ iâ€™m currently working on several projects in .net and nexjs <br>
âœ¨ also trying to learn python <br>
âœ¨ fun fact: the first computer bug was an actual bug - in 1947, engineers found a moth causing issues in the mark ii computer. this is how the term "debugging" came to be. lol <br>
